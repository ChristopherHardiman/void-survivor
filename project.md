# üöÄ Project: Fyrox Arena Survivor

A 3D top-down arena survival shooter built with the **Fyrox game engine**.  
Core gameplay: survive waves of enemies, collect loot, level up, and upgrade your ship between rounds.

## üéÆ Core Gameplay Loop
1. Player fights through enemy waves.  
2. Enemies drop EXP, health, and special recharge items.  
3. Player can **pause wave manually** ‚Üí access level-up screen (choose 1 upgrade).  
4. Between waves ‚Üí **shop phase** ‚Üí buy ship upgrades/weapons.  
5. Waves get progressively harder and longer.

### 1. Player System
- Movement: WASD + mouse aim (twin-stick style).  
- Weapons: shader/particle driven (blaster, laser, rockets, AoE pulse).  
- Stats: health, shields, special energy, exp.  
- Level-up: triggered by EXP threshold or player pausing the wave.  

### 2. Enemy System
- Types:  
  - Chaser (melee).

  - Tank (slow, high HP).  
- Spawning managed by **Wave Manager**.  
- Drops loot: EXP orbs, health packs, special energy.  

### 3. Wave Manager
- Controls wave spawning, timers, and scaling difficulty.  
- Handles "pause wave" mechanic.  
- Notifies UI when wave ends (transition to shop).  

### 4. Upgrade & Level-Up System
- **Mid-wave level-up**:  
  - Pauses wave, shows UI with 2‚Äì3 random upgrades.  
- **Upgrade types**:  
  - Weapon upgrades (damage, fire rate, projectile count).  
  - Ship upgrades (speed, armor, shield recharge).  
  - Special upgrades (area attacks, drones, energy regen).  

### 5. Shop System (Between Waves)
- Uses currency dropped from enemies.  
- Purchasable items:  
  - New weapons.  
  - Ship upgrades.  
  - Special abilities.  
- UI menu with item name, description, and cost.  

### 6. Loot & Items
- EXP Orbs ‚Üí increase level bar.  
- Health Packs ‚Üí restore HP.  
- Energy Cells ‚Üí recharge special attacks.  

### 7. UI System
- **HUD**:  
  - Health bar, shield bar, EXP bar, wave timer.  
- **Overlays**:  
  - Level-up screen (choice UI).  
  - Shop screen (between waves).  
- **Menu system**: Start game, settings, quit.  

### 8. Visual Effects
- Weapons use **shaders + particles**:  
  - Bullets: glowing particles.  
  - Lasers: custom shader beam.  
  - Explosions: GPU particle burst.  
- Arena visuals:  
  - Simple floor/arena mesh.  
  - Ambient lighting.  
  - Minimal obstacles.  

### 9. Audio
- Background music loop.
