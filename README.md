### Executors
- **`executor/`** - Desktop executable
- **`executor-wasm/`** - Web build target
- **`executor-android/`** - Android build target
- **`editor/`** - Fyrox editor integration

## Current Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Base project structure and Cargo workspace setup
- Core game system modules defined
- Asset directory structure organized
- Configuration system with balance parameters
- Development roadmap created

ðŸ”§ **Next Steps (Phase 1):**
1. Fix Fyrox Plugin trait implementation
2. Create basic 3D arena scene
3. Implement player movement and shooting
4. Add basic enemy spawning and AI

## Core Gameplay Concept

**Survival Loop:**
1. Fight waves of enemies (Chasers, Shooters, Tanks)
2. Collect EXP, health, and currency drops
3. Level up mid-wave with upgrade choices
4. Shop between waves for new weapons and abilities
5. Survive progressively harder waves

**Key Features:**
- **Twin-stick style controls** - WASD movement + mouse aim
- **Multiple weapons** - Blaster, Laser, Rockets, AoE Pulse
- **Manual wave pausing** - Choose when to level up
- **Shop system** - Buy upgrades between waves
- **Shader-driven effects** - Particles and glowing visuals

## Development Timeline

- **Phases 1-2 (Weeks 1-4):** Core gameplay loop
- **Phase 3 (Weeks 5-6):** Shop system and weapon variety  
- **Phase 4 (Weeks 7-8):** Visual and audio polish
- **Phases 5-6 (Weeks 9-12):** Advanced features and final polish

See `roadmap.md` for detailed development phases and tasks.

## Quick Start

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   cargo build
   ```

2. **Run the editor:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin editor
   ```

3. **Run the game:**
   ```bash
   cargo run --bin executor
   ```

## Asset Requirements (MVP)

**Essential 3D Models:**
- Player ship (small fighter)
- 3x Enemy drones (Chaser, Shooter, Tank)
- Loot items (EXP orb, health pack, energy cell)
- Basic projectiles (blaster bolt, rocket)

**Essential Effects:**
- Weapon muzzle flashes and trails
- Enemy death explosions  
- Loot glow shaders
- Arena boundary visual

**Essential Audio:**
- Weapon firing sounds
- Enemy death sounds
- Loot pickup audio
- Background music loop

## Design Philosophy

- **"Juice over realism"** - Focus on satisfying visual/audio feedback
- **Shader-driven effects** - Minimize complex 3D assets, maximize shaders
- **Simple but deep** - Easy to learn, depth through upgrade combinations
- **Incremental development** - Build, test, iterate quickly

The goal is to create a highly polished, focused arcade experience that feels great to play.
