Perfect ðŸ‘Œ â€” going full **space backdrop with shaders** will save you from needing a ton of environmental assets. Youâ€™ll just need ships, enemies, items, and some FX meshes.

Hereâ€™s a **`model_asset_list.md`** you can drop into your `/docs` folder:

# ðŸš€ Model Asset List â€“ Fyrox Arena Survivor

All assets are **3D models** unless noted.  
The arena background is **shader-generated space** (stars, nebula, parallax layers).  
Models should be **low-poly, clean silhouettes**, with shaders/particles providing most of the flair.

---

## 1. Player
- **Player Ship**
  - Small, sleek spacefighter.  
  - Hardpoints for weapons (blasters, lasers, rockets).

- **Chaser Drone**
  - Spherical or spiky drone that rushes player.  
- **Shooter Drone**
