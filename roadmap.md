## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Fyrox Integration Complexity**: The engine is less documented than others
- **Performance**: Particle systems and entity counts may impact performance
- **Scope Creep**: Feature additions could delay core gameplay

### Medium Risk
- **Balance Tuning**: May require extensive playtesting
- **Asset Creation**: 3D models and effects require art skills or outsourcing

### Low Risk
- **Code Architecture**: Well-planned modular structure should support changes
- **Technical Features**: Most gameplay systems are well-understood patterns

## Success Metrics
